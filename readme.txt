Solution:

In this application, I have added two dropdowns for Vehicle Make and Model. The data is being fetched from the api which is available
in the services folder. Also, the application tries to call the apis maximum three times when it notices a failure.
Once you get the Vehicles data, you will see set of filters whose main purpose is to filter out the vehicle information.
The dropdown is a third party library. It is a ligth weight and simple library which doesn't have any other dependency. I saw the usecase
of this particular widget and though of using it in this application.
